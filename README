To Compile
mkdir bin
cd build
make all

This will compile everything in bin from the root

Or if you don't have make installed open the Makefile in the build directory and manually
type the commands

To run:
Either double click on KeepyUppy.jar or
On Linux:
make run.sh executable
type ./run.sh

The object of the game:
To keep the ball from hitting the ground.

Have fun.
